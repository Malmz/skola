## Introduction
* Im going to show you the room of Carl Malmgren. Its a preserved room from 700 years ago. 


## Workspace
* As you can see, this workspace is extremly messy. The person who lived here wasn't very good at cleaning. Looking closer you might think this setup is quite primitive, but back in the day, this was top of the line hardware.

## Bookshelf
* Moving on to the "bookshelf". Today, all books are digitaly stored, but originally book where stored in bundles of papper (point at books). So to store all these books you needed a bookshelf. But Carl was obviously not that into reading because his bookshelf isn't filled with books but with other junk.
