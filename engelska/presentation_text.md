## Introduction

* Im going to show you the room of Carl Malmgren. It's very well preserved and around 700 years ago. 


## Workspace

* As you can see, this workspace is extremly messy. The person who lived here wasn't very good at cleaning. Looking closer you might think this setup is quite primitive, but back in the day, this was top of the line hardware.

## Bookshelf

* Moving on to the "bookshelf". Today, all books are digitaly stored, but originally book where stored in bundles of papper (point at books). So to store all these books you needed a bookshelf. But Carl was obviously not that into reading because his bookshelf isn't filled with books but with other junk.

### Closer look

* Lets take a closer look at what we can find in this bookshelf. We can see he atleast had some books. But above that it's just a complete mess. One interesting thing tough is this.

###  Badminton and picture

* Seeing this ball here we can guess that he played badminton, and behind there is what looks like a baseball bat, so possibly baseball too.

* You might have noticed the picture standing in the corner, doing some research and thanks to Facebook's archive of people relations, we found out that this is a friend of Carl from middle school.

### Art supplies

* He also had some basic art supplies, most likely just a hobby since we looked at some of the drawings and they weren't all that good.

## Other half

* Moving on we have a drawer, not that interesting, and a bed.

* Judging by the amount of bottles here, we can assume that he either drinks a lot of soda, doesn't clean that often or both.
